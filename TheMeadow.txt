The Meadow

Where is the light,
and where is the shadow,
I stand lost,
lost in a gray meadow,

Where is the sun,
and where is the moon,
Waiting to be enlightened,
waiting to be a loon,

The rooster cries,
the wolf moans,
I am lost in the meadow,
and all I feel is sand and stone.

Night of Poets and Saints

It’s the night of poets,
Outside,
under cloudy moon sky,

We see each other in the halo,
burning silver,
We feel each other,
Through moist kisses,
Hug the breeze,

It’s the night of watching,
No skeptical insights,
No longer critics,

Under the moonlight,
Only saints appear.
